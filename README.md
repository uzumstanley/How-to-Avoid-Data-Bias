# How-to-Avoid-Data-Bias

• The prevention of data bias in machine learning projects is an 
ongoing process. 
• Though it is sometimes difficult to know when your machine 
learning algorithm, data or model is biased, there are a number of 
steps you can take to help prevent bias or catch it early.

• To the best of your ability, research your users in advance. Be 
aware of your general use-cases and potential outliers.

• Enlist the help of someone with domain expertise to review your 
collected and/or annotated data. Someone from outside of your 
team may see biases that your team has overlooked.

• Ensure your team of data scientists and data labellers is diverse.

• Where possible, combine inputs from multiple sources to ensure 
data diversity.
