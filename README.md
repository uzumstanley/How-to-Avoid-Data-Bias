# How-to-Avoid-Data-Bias

• The prevention of data bias in machine learning projects is an 
ongoing process. 
• Though it is sometimes difficult to know when your machine 
learning algorithm, data or model is biased, there are a number of 
steps you can take to help prevent bias or catch it early.
• To the best of your ability, research your users in advance. Be 
aware of your general use-cases and potential outliers.
